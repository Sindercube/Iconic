# ⭐ About

**Iconic** is a **Fabric client-side Mod** which allows modpack developers and resource pack creators to change a bunch of hard-coded text-related features.

> **Warning**
> Iconic is currently in an early state, and is prone to breaking changes. It's more of a proof-of-concept than something you should use seriously.

# 📘 Features

- Add new splash texts which don't override existing texts.
- Create icons which you can easily use in JSON text.
- Use emotes in chat with a Markdown-like syntax.
<!-- - Change how tooltips in the game are styled. -->

> For a full list of features, and explanations on how to use them, go to the [wiki](iconic.sindercu.be/).

# 📝 Credits

- The `minecraft:five` font added by the mod is inspired by the Five font from Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
- The implementation of the emote system is nearly identical to the one added by [Emoji Type](https://modrinth.com/mod/emoji-type), but the emotes suggested to you are defined in resource packs, not in a config file.
